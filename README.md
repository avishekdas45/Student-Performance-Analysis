# 📚 Student Performance Analysis
📖This project explores and analyzes factors influencing student performance using data visualization and statistical insights.


Welcome to the **Student Performance Analysis** project! 🎓 This project delves into the various **demographic and socio-economic factors** that affect student outcomes using a **data-driven approach**. By combining Python-based EDA, SQL queries, and statistical methods, the project aims to **reveal patterns** that could be crucial for educators, parents, and policymakers.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Understand **key factors** that influence student performance.
- Explore the dataset through **visualizations and correlations**.
- Perform **statistical tests** to draw meaningful inferences.
- Create a **modular and well-documented project** structure for future scalability.

---

## 🔍 Dataset Overview

We use the [Student Performance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams) from Kaggle, which includes:

- Gender  
- Race/ethnicity  
- Parental level of education  
- Lunch type  
- Test preparation course  
- Math, reading, and writing scores

This structured and labeled dataset is ideal for both **exploratory** and **predictive** analysis.

## 📈 Analysis Highlights

- **Parental education** strongly correlates with student performance.
- **Students who completed test prep** scored higher across all subjects.
- Gender differences are more pronounced in math scores (males slightly ahead).
